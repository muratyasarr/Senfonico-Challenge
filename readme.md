# Senfonico Challenge
## Challenge 1: List of Photos

### Create a list view where the user can scroll through photos that are downloaded from a remote source. As soon as the app launches, the app makes a request to a public API, such as Flickrs, and shows some photosâ€™ thumbnails in either a grid or list view. Tapping on a photo shows the a larger photo. Design is up to you. Feel free to be as creative as you want. While not forbidden, we believe strong candidates can finish this challenge without using external libraries.
